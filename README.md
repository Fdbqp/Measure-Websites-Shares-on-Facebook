# Measure-Websites-Shares-on-Facebook
automation script to measure how often a url was shared on facebook

Intention: 
a friend of mine was analyzing the impact of social media on crowdfunding campagnes in his research.
I wanted to help him automating his observation process in counting the growth. 
So I focussed with this script on counting facebook shares for a bunch of URLs using Facebook's Graph API and make myself a little more familiar with the JSON format an solving a real problem , which is why we use software in its origin purpose. 

I used python for that. 


How to run a Python Script from Mac OS X Finder (in a shell):

0. Place your script on the desktop for instance
1. Make the first line in the python script:  #!/usr/bin/env python
2. Change the file’s extension from xyz.py to xyz.command
3. Change directory to the file’s path(here desktop) by cd desktop
4. Make the script file executable by writing in terminal:   chmod +x xyz.command
5. Now when you double click the Python script in Finder it will open a terminal window an run.
